Generate a large set of concise, simple, and practical auditory scene or speech effect descriptions. 

Each sentence should combine:

A sound subject ({
    "person": [
      "a male",
      "a female"
    ],
    "instrument": [
      "electric guitar",
      "acoustic guitar",
      "grand piano",
      "upright piano",
      "drum kit",
      "violin",
      "cello",
      "flute",
      "saxophone",
      "trumpet"
    ]
  }),

One or two clear audio effects (e.g., robotic, monster-like, distorted, lo-fi, echoing, reverberant, phaser, muffled, compressed, etc.),

And an acoustic environment (e.g., large hall, stone cave, gymnasium, cathedral, subway, bathroom, underwater, windy rooftop, beach, forest, etc.).

Avoid literary and overly complex sentences.

Do NOT add vivid scene details, stories, background sounds, or indirect metaphors.

Focus on clear description of who/what is making the sound, what effect is applied, and the environment, but make it complete sentence.

Each description should be one short English sentence, easy for a sound designer or algorithm to interpret as “what kind of audio effect to apply”.

Variety is important: mix different combinations of sound source, effect, and environment; minimize repetition.

Make sure that produced sentences are not overlapped with the sentences above.
